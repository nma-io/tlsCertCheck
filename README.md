Just a simple app to check fingerprints and version info. 

Note: a better way of doing this is using Project Discovery's TLSX like so:

```bash 
tlsx -ve -hash sha256 -u https://site.com
```

This app was just created for those who can't install tlsx or need to have the function integrated into their own code.
